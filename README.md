# Necromancer_Development
TS WoW Personal Necromancer Development.

This is a ReadMe for those interested.

My Necromancer class has no finish-by date. It will be completed when I feel it is justified to deem it as such, and will be submitted for approval to be used as an
intermediate complexity tutorial for datascripting and livescripting, in the form of a custom class.

If you have read this, I appreciate you and for taking the time to do so. May you have a wonderful day.
